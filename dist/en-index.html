Each library works in its own way, which only adds to the inconvenience. Read the documentation carefully. The basic basics of working with the plugin are described in the section working with the library <span class="info">animate.css</span>. Be sure to read this section even if you plan to use a different library for CSS animations.</p></div><h2 class="heading">Getting started</h2><p class="text">Install the plugin in your project using NPM</p><pre>
            <code>
            npm install --save animation-assistant
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">Connect it in a convenient way:</p><p class="text">CommonJS:</p><pre>
            <code>

            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">First you need to get an instance of the class <span class="info">AnimationAssistant</span> by calling the appropriate constructor and passing it the CSS selector of the animated elements. For example:</p><p>HTML</p><pre>
            <code>
            &lt;div class="forAnimation">  &lt;/div>
            </code>

            const animation = new AnimationAssistant('forAnimation');
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">It can be either a single element or a group of elements:</p><p>HTML</p><pre>
            <code>
            &lt;div class="your-class">    &lt;/div>

            <code>
            const animation = new AnimationAssistant('your-class');
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">Now to the object <span class="info">animation</span> a number of methods are available for working with animations. The object does not have to be called that way, moreover, they can (and in some cases should) there may be several, since each object will only work with the elements passed to it. We will start from this name just as an example.</p><div class="notice"><p class="notice-text">Don't forget to install the library itself as a dependency in your project, if it's npm, or just add the link tag with a link to the library's cdn.</p></div><p class="text"><span class="info">setLibrary</span> - Prepares the selected CSS library for use. Mandatory method that sets the library you selected for working with animations by adding the necessary prefix to the animated elements. For example <span class="info">animation.setLibrary('animate.css')</span> adds a prefix to the elements of one of the most famous CSS libraries for working with animations - <span class="info">animate__animated</span> and will allow you to work with this library.</p><p class="text"><span class="info">addClasses</span> - Accepts an array with classes. Sometimes we need to add a number of additional classes to the elements. Let's say, following the example above - it can be <span class="info">animation.addClasses(['animate__slower', 'animate__repeat-2'])</span>, since we want the animation to be slow and repeat twice. You can see these classes for yourself on the official library page <a href="https://animate.style/">animation.css</a>. Different libraries have their own helper classes or helper classes, you can install them using this method. It is important to understand that they will be installed immediately, without starting from the position on the page, events, and other things.</p><p class="text"><span class="info">hideAtStart</span> - Hides the element until the animation starts. Sometimes it will be better to hide the element before the animation starts. For example, using the animation of the appearance of an element on the right, it will be strange to watch how the element is displayed on the page, then as you scroll to it, an event occurs and it disappears to pop up on the side. It is much better to hide it initially leaving an empty space where it was before the event was triggered. <span class="info">animation.hideAtStart()</span> solves this problem.</p><p class="text"><span class="info">adaptEnvironment</span> - Adapts the element's environment for the animations to work correctly. When the CSS animation is played in place or appears on the left or top, the user does not experience any inconvenience. As soon as the animation starts to use the lower and right edges of the browser, going there at the end of the action or appearing from there, we may notice the appearance of a horizontal scroll or an increase in the length of the vertical scroll. The reason for this is that the element itself continues to take up space on the page, expanding the latter. For such animations to work correctly, you need to add <span class="info">overflow: hidden</span> to the parent element, which is what this method does. If the parent of the animated element is a tag <span class="info">BODY</span>, then this method creates a special stub for this case as well.</p><p class="text"><span class="info">setAnimation</span> - Configures the animation to work. The main method for working with animations. Accepts three parameters. <span class="info">offset</span> - a number from 1 to 100 indicating the percentage distance from the animated element to the top edge of the browser window to trigger the animation. <span class="info">name</span> - the name of the animation that the library provides. <span class="info">animationEnd</span> - callback function that will be executed after the animation is completed. Examples are given below.</p><p class="text"><span class="info">play</span> - Starts the animation. Unlike <span class="info">setAnimation</span> it starts the animation immediately without waiting for the action of any dibo event, but looking ahead - nothing will prevent you from coming up with such an event. Accepts two parameters. <span class="info">name</span> - the name of the animation that the library provides. <span class="info">timeout</span> - the time after which the next animation should start, with the default value of 2000ms. Note that the specified time in the parameter <span class="info">timeout</span> it does not guarantee that the next animation will start after the time you specified or the default value if it was not set. It guarantees that the next animation will start no earlier than the time you specified. The method returns a promise. Examples are given below.</p><h2 class="heading">General requirements</h2><p class="text">Regardless of which library you are going to work with, you should install it using npm or cdn. Then you need to create a new instance of the class <span class="info">AnimationAssistant</span> by passing there the CSS selector of the elements with which you will work. Examples were given above.</p><p class="text">We will also describe here general methods for working with elements independently of the library:</p><pre>
            <code>
            const animation = new AnimationAssistant('your-classes'); <span class="code-comment">// select the elements we need</span>
            animation.setLibrary('your-library'); <span class="code-comment">// installing the library</span>
            animation.addClasses(['first-class', 'second-class']); <span class="code-comment">// adding the necessary classes</span>
            animation.hideAtStart(); <span class="code-comment">// making the element invisible until the animation starts </span>
            animation.adaptEnvironment(); <span class="code-comment">// adapting the environment</span>
            animation.onPhone(680); <span class="code-comment">// does not activate animations on a screen resolution of less than 680px </span>
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">These were the main methods for working with animations of which only one is mandatory - <span class="info">animation.setLibrary('your-library')</span>.</p><p class="text">Two main methods for working with animations - <span class="info">setAnimation</span> and <span class="info">play</span> we'll look at it later, along with the supported CSS animation libraries..</p><h2 class="heading">Information about the plugin operation</h2><p class="text">Method <span class="info">setLibrary</span> is mandatory, do not forget to call it before you start working.</p><p class="text">Method <span class="info">play</span> is asynchronous and returns a promise. Use it to animate elements on the start screen or in your own events to draw users ' attention to the element or to its appearance or removal. We recommend using the value <span class="info">once: true</span> since repeated interaction of this method with other user events will result in an error.</p><p class="text">Method <span class="info">setAnimation</span> configures the parameter <span class="info">offset</span> only for items that will occur when scrolling down. If you scroll the page up, this parameter will be ignored and the element will be reanimated as soon as its lower edge is equal to the upper edge of the browser window.</p><p class="text">Methods <span class="info">setAnimation</span> and <span class="info">play</span> they must be called by the most recent ones for the plugin to work more correctly.</p><h2 class="heading">Recommendations</h2><p class="text">Do not animate the root element and <span class="info">BODY</span>. This is possible, but it should not be done.</p><p class="text">Don't just use animation. Animation is an element of interaction with the user on the site. Animation can attract attention, remind you of something, or make it clear that the action was performed.</p><p class="text">Use a single library. The plugin supports different libraries, but you should not use them all at once. It is not advisable to use more than one library on the site.</p><p class="text">Method <span class="info">setAnimation</span> assigns an event handler <span class="info">scroll</span> on the group of elements with which it works. Remember that if you have 10 instances of an object on your site <span class="info">AnimationAssistant</span>, then you have 10 handlers available on the object <span class="info">window</span>. This is a performance issue.</p><p class="text">Most often you will want to use the parameter <span class="info">offset</span> in the value of 100. In this position, the element will be animated immediately after its upper edge is aligned with the lower edge of the browser window. In most cases, this is what we need, since users can scroll the page very quickly and simply not notice the animation if this parameter is set to a lower value, such as 10 or 20.</p><p class="text">The library can provide animation that will be in infinite mode. In this case you should be prepared for a number of limitations including incorrect operation of the method <span class="info">play</span> and the inability to call the callback function in the method <span class="info">setAnimation</span>.</p><p class="text">If you do not want the animation to be played on tablet devices or mobile phones, then add the CSS class that you used when selecting elements by the plugin and set it two fields at the breakpoint you are interested in - <span class="info">visibility: visible !important</span> and <span class="info">animation-name: none !important</span>. For example, you have a class selector <span class="info">for-animation</span> and you start from this when using the plugin:</p><pre>
            <code>
            const myAnimation = new AnimationAssistant('for-animation');
            myAnimation.setLibrary('library');
            myAnimation.setAnimation(...settings);
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">You don't want this animation to play on devices with screen sizes smaller than 670px. Just add the following rules to the css:</p><pre>
            <code>
            @media screen and (max-width: 670px) {
                .for-animation {
                    visibility: visible !important;
                    animation-name: none !important;
                }
            }
            </code>
            </pre><div class="notice"><p class="notice-text">Sometimes you may notice strange behavior of animated elements at the very end of the page. For example, instead of two elements, only one can be activated. What happens if we set a very small parameter <span class="info">offset</span> for the elements at the very end of the document? In theory, they will not have to activate the animation, but the plugin has a special stub for such cases, and as soon as the document is scrolled to the end, all the elements within the view of the user's browser window will be animated. But if the animation will raise the element from the bottom-up, then only one of the two elements standing on the same level can be animated. This is because one animated element will stretch the vertical scroll of the page for a second, and the next element that is on the same level with it will not fix the end of scrolling for the current document. To prevent such situations, you can use the method <span class="info">adaptEnvironment</span>.</p></div><h2 class="heading" id="animate.css">animate.css</h2><p class="text">To get started with the library <span class="info">animate.css</span> create a new instance of the class and set the library as a dependency:</p><pre>

            animationCssExamplePlay.setLibrary('animate.css');
            </code>
            </pre><p class="text">Then you can call the method <span class="info">play</span> and play the animation. As you may remember, this method takes the name of the animation and the number of milliseconds to start the next animation. By going to the library's website <a href="https://animate.style/">animate.css</a> you can choose the animations that interest us, let's say they turned out to be: <span class="info">animate__headShake</span>, <span class="info">animate__rubberBand</span> and <span class="info">animate__tada</span>. Install them:</p><pre>

The parameter is responsible for this <span class="info">offset</span>. Let's say we decided that it would be 20%. That is, as soon as the element is less than 20% from the top edge of the browser window, the animation will be played.
